## Project Spec

**Matching Platform**
"I want to help but where do I start?"

The idea: A lot of people want to volunteer but don't know where to start. Meanwhile, nonprofits desperately need help but struggle to find reliable volunteers. This platform bridges that gap — matching people with volunteer opportunities based on their skills, interests, availability, and location.

Think about what makes someone actually follow through on volunteering. It's not just finding an opportunity — it's finding the right opportunity. Someone who loves animals shouldn't see tutoring gigs first. Someone who can only help on weekends needs to filter by availability. How do you make the matching feel personal, not like a job board?
